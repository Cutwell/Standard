#  Standard
Raise your flag, share content with others
---

Standard was born out of a need for a quick and easy way to share files with local users, but without the hassle of both users needing a copy of the software.
All that's needed to use Standard is a single copy of the this repository on the host computer, and access to a web-browser to download the file.

### Obtaining Standard:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Cutwell/Standard
```

### How to use Standard:
```
$ cd standard/source
$ python3 flag_bearer.py file.md password
>>> local ip: 
>>> server running on localhost:8081/standard
```
 - users can now visit [your local ip]/standard to download the file.
